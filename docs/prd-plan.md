## Plan Style Selection & Reasoning

### Considered Plan Styles:
1. **Waterfall Sequential Plan**: Linear phases with dependencies
2. **Agile Sprint-Based Plan**: Iterative development with sprints
3. **Feature-Driven Plan**: Organized by user stories and features
4. **Technical Layer Plan**: Backend → Frontend → Integration approach
5. **Hybrid Modular Plan**: Combination of technical layers with feature-driven implementation

### Selected Approach: **Hybrid Modular Plan**

**Reasoning:**
- **LLM-Friendly**: Clear, actionable steps that can be easily interpreted by AI assistants
- **Modular Structure**: Each module can be developed and tested independently
- **Progressive Implementation**: Builds from core infrastructure to advanced features
- **Clear Dependencies**: Explicitly shows what needs to be completed before moving to next steps
- **Flexible**: Allows for parallel development of non-dependent modules
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all aspects from setup to deployment

- [ ] **Backend Setup**
  - Initialize Node.js/Express server
  - Install dependencies: express, mongoose, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, cors, dotenv
  - Set up basic server structure with middleware
  - Configure environment variables (.env)

- [ ] **Frontend Setup**
  - Initialize React application with Vite
  - Install dependencies: react-router-dom, axios, bootstrap
  - Set up basic component structure

## Phase 2: Core Backend Development

### 2.1 Database Models
- [ ] **User Model**
  - Create User schema with email, password, role
  - Add validation rules
  - Implement password hashing middleware

- [ ] **Car Listing Model**
  - Create CarListing schema with all required fields
  - Add validation for price, year, image URL
  - Implement availability status

- [ ] **Transaction Model**
  - Create Transaction schema
  - Link to User and CarListing models
  - Add status tracking

### 2.2 Authentication System
- [ ] **Auth Middleware**
  - JWT token generation and verification
  - Password hashing with bcrypt
  - Role-based access control middleware

- [ ] **Auth Routes**
  - POST /api/auth/register
  - POST /api/auth/login
  - POST /api/auth/logout

### 2.3 Core API Endpoints
- [ ] **Car Listing Routes**
  - GET /api/cars (with pagination, search, filters)
  - GET /api/cars/:id
  - POST /api/cars (admin only)
  - PUT /api/cars/:id (admin only)
  - DELETE /api/cars/:id (admin only)

- [ ] **Transaction Routes**
  - POST /api/transactions
  - GET /api/transactions/user/:userId
  - GET /api/transactions/:id
  - All of these are protected routes. only logged in user can start start transactions.
  - once transaction done that particular car should be unavailable. 

### 2.4 Backend Testing
- [ ] **API Testing**
  - Test all endpoints with Postman (optional)
  - Verify authentication flows
  - Test error handling
